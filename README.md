# Student Score Analysis and Prediction

A comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on analyzing student performance using the UCI student dataset containing 33 features across 396 instances.

## Dataset Features

The analysis includes key student attributes:

- Academic Performance (Grades)
- Attendance (Absences)
- Health Metrics
- Lifestyle Factors:
  - Daily/Weekly Alcohol Consumption
  - Free Time Management
  - Internet Usage
- Academic Factors:
  - Study Time
  - Travel Time to School

## Technical Stack

### Python Libraries

- NumPy: Numerical computations and array operations
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization
- Matplotlib: Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning implementations
- Pickle: Model serialization

### Machine Learning Models

- K-means Clustering: Student grouping analysis
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction
- Decision Tree: Classification and prediction
- Random Forest: Ensemble learning for improved accuracy
- Linear Regression: Score prediction

## Analysis Workflow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training and Evaluation
5. Performance Prediction

## Goals

- Analyze factors affecting student performance
- Predict student scores based on various features
